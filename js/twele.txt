when we use async with function , it will return promise . 
 this behave is like asynchrously...
   await means return from that point. complete other work..

In array we store the values, but in Generaters we generate values in sequential way...

map()
map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provide function on every element in the calling array...

the map objects holds key-value pairs & remember the origional insertion order of the keys.
 both object & primitive values may be used as either a key or value...

 const map1 = new Map();

map1.set('a', 1);
console.log(map1.get('a'));
console.log(map1.size);
map1.delete('b');
map1.has('Jessie')
